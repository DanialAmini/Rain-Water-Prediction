# Prediction of Rain Water Harvested using ARIMA (Auto Regression Integrated Moving Average ) and LSTM

Several techniques have been formerly proposed to predict rainfall based on statistical analysis, machine learning and deep learning techniques. Prediction of time series data in meteorology can assist
in decision-making processes carried out by organizations to predict the amount of rainfall harvested which is important part of recycling water.
This study presents Intensified Long Short-Term Memory (Intensified LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict rainfall. The neural network is trained and tested using a standard
dataset of rainfall. The trained network will produce predicted attribute of rain harvested. The parameters considered for the evaluation of the performance and the efficiency of the proposed rainfall prediction
model are Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accuracy, number of epochs, loss, and learning rate of the network. The results obtained are compared with Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Recurrent Neural Network and Long
Short-Term Memory models in order to exemplify the improvement in the ability to predict rainfall.
